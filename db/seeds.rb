# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# 100.times do |counter|
#   Blog.create!(title: "Book title #{counter}", content: "This is book content #{counter}")
# end

# 100.times do | index |

# 	Blog.create(
